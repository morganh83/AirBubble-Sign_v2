This repository is a specific build of the "On-Air" project (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3111075)
It adds a wifi fallback captive portal so that you can configure your wifi credentials. This is still a work in progress.

Known Bugs:
 - When connecting to the SSID, you do not get a DHCP IP
 - MQTT Configs do not work. Must hard-code them

TODO:
 - Fix configuration section to allow changing MQTT details
 - Create new dashboard to control light and display current status
 - Fix DHCP server
 - Make pretty
 -
